    REPLICATION
    Keeping copies of databases on multiple servers

    MODELS OF REPLICATIONS
        SINGLE LEADER
        One db server that takes care of everything and then sends it out to followers
        
        MULTI-LEADER
        Multiple db servers instead of just one
        
        LEADERLESS

    READ REPLICA
    A copy of a db from which data is only  read

    SYNCHROUNOUS REPLICATION
        Client to Leader request
        Leader to Follower request
        Follower to Leader OK
        Leader to Client OK
        
        PRO: Data is secure
        CON: Redundant - Takes time
        
    ASYNCRONOUNOUS REPLICATION
        Client to Leader request
        Leader to Client OK && Leader to Follower Request
        Follower to Client OK

        PRO: Faster
        CON: Possible data corruption

SHARDING
Splitting up certain data into seperate db
    Problems
    Some specific servers may overload
    Single Point of Failure: If one system goes down, entire system isn't useable
